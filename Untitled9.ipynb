    "Exceptions in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions are runtime errors that occur during the execution of a program.\n",
    "They disrupt the normal flow of the program if not handled properly.\n",
    "Examples of exceptions include ZeroDivisionError, TypeError, FileNotFoundError, etc.\n",
    "Exceptions can be handled using try-except blocks to gracefully manage errors and prevent program crashes.\n",
    "Syntax Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors, on the other hand, occur during the parsing of code, i.e., while interpreting the syntax of the code.\n",
    "They are generally caused by typos, incorrect indentation, or improper use of language elements.\n",
    "Syntax errors prevent the program from being compiled or interpreted and need to be fixed before the program can run.\n",
    "Common examples of syntax errors include missing colons, unmatched parentheses, misspelled keywords, etc.\n",
    "In summary, exceptions occur during the execution of the program due to unforeseen circumstances, while syntax errors occur during the parsing of the code due to incorrect syntax. Handling exceptions allows Python programs to gracefully recover from errors and continue execution, while syntax errors must be fixed before the program can run at all."

    "When an exception is not handled, it typically leads to the termination of the program's normal execution flow. This means that when an exception occurs and is not caught or handled properly, the program will abruptly stop, and depending on the environment and context, it might display an error message or simply crash without any user-friendly explanation.\n",

    "In this example, the divide_numbers function attempts to perform a division operation between two numbers x and y. However, if y is zero, a ZeroDivisionError exception will be raised. In the provided code, there's a try-except block that catches this specific exception and prints an error message. However, there's no handling for other types of exceptions.\n",

    "python\n",

    "result = divide_numbers(10, 'a')\n",
    "print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "In this case, passing 'a' as the second argument to divide_numbers will result in a TypeError because you cannot perform arithmetic operations between a number and a string. Since the code doesn't handle TypeError, the program will terminate abruptly, and depending on the environment, you might see a traceback message indicating the type of exception that occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, when an exception is not handled, the program flow is disrupted, and the program might crash or terminate unexpectedly, leaving the issue unaddressed and potentially causing inconvenience or data loss. It's crucial to handle exceptions appropriately in order to maintain the robustness and reliability of the software."

    "Expressiveness: Custom exceptions allow developers to create meaningful names for specific error conditions in their code. This enhances code readability and makes it easier to understand the nature of errors that occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Granular Error Handling: By defining custom exceptions, developers can handle different error scenarios separately and precisely, providing more granular control over error handling logic.\n",

    "Modularity: Custom exceptions can be organized into a hierarchy, allowing for modular and structured error handling. This makes it easier to maintain and extend error handling capabilities as the codebase evolves.\n",
